        <h3><a href="http://www.tabswithme.com">Tabs With Me</a></h3>
        <p> 
            This is a website that I built to my roommates and I share our bills.  Whenever we pay a bill or pay a roommate we track it here, it is very clear who owes what.  I built this with python, django, appengine and bootstrap.

        <p>
          A python module to automatically retry functions if they raise an exceptions.  RetryPy offers three different interfaces: a decorator, a wrapper, and a direct call method.  RetryPy offers intelligent logic to determent what exceptions should be retried.
