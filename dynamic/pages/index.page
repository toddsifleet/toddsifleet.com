        <p> 
            This is a website that I built to my roommates and I share our bills.  Whenever we pay a bill or pay a roommate we track it here, it is very clear who owes what.  I built this with python, django, appengine and bootstrap.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/toddsifleet/sublime_open">Sublime Text Plugin</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is a plugin that makes navigating your files a breeze within <a href = "http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.  It tracks recent files, favorite files/places allows you to navigate the file tree right from the keyboard.  Tracks different projects, so if you switch between branches/projects it is easy to keep things separate.
