        I am a mechanical engineer by training, but I focus on software and electrical systems.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in math from <a href="http://www.union.edu"  target="_blank">Union College</a>.  After Union I went to <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> for a Master of Science degree, at GT I focused on the design and fabrication of mechatronic (mechanical, electrical, and software) systems.

        Since finishing school I have been working and learning about software engineering and I love.  I currently work at <a href = "//athenahealth.com">athenahealth</a> in Boston as a software developer, we are solving some really challenging problems related to healthcare technology.

         At Athena I started out working on interfaces between our software and other independent systems.  Working on interfaces I learned a lot about the challenges and requirements for successful data portability.  This year I started working on rebuilding how he handle clinical orders, it has been quite a challenge.
