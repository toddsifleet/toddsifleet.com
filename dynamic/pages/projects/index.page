    These are some of the projects that I have built over the course of time, mostly they are things I did out of curiosity or to solve a personal need.  For the most part they revolve around python, arduino and the web, to view more of my work visit my <a href="http://www.github.com/toddsifleet" targe= "_blank">github profile</a>.
