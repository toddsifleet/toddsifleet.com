    Tabs with me is an webapp to facilitate the sharing of bills/expenses between roommates and friends.  I built it with app engine, python (django) and bootstrap.

    This is a website that I built to help my roommates and I share our bills.  Instead of keeping a spreadsheet of what bills we pay we just add them to the tab.
