    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <a name="python"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">python:<span class = "strong pull-right">STRONG</span></h4>
    <p>
        I have been writing python since 2007 including web sites, number crunching, command line utilities, machine learning.  Python is my favorite language to work in, I love it!
    </p>

    <a name="ruby"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">ruby: <span class = "strong pull-right">STRONG</span></h4>
    <p>
        I have been programming Ruby/Rails since early 2013.  I really enjoy the style and speed of ruby development.  Rails in my opinion is the quickest way to build dynamic web applications.
    </p>

    <a name="javascript"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">javascript <span class = "strong pull-right">STRONG</span></h4>
    <p>
        I currently use javascript both on the client and the server.  On the client I use <a href = "http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> to build dynamic one page applications.  On the server I use <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a>, at uber we use Node extensivley to build realtime services. 
    </p>    

    <a name="css-html"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">css and html <span class = "proficient pull-right">PROFICIENT</span></h4>
    <p>
        I am by no means a designer, but I am great at implementing effective web sites/interfaces.  For consistent and responsive designs I use <a href = "http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, I also use <a href = "http://lesscss.org/">less</a> to make my CSS <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRYER</a>.  I am awlays working on getting better as a designer.
    </p>
    
    <a name="perl"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">perl: <span class = "rusty pull-right">RUSTY</span></h4>
    <p>
      I used to write a lot of perl but have not been using it recently.  I now use python and ruby where I would have used perl previously.
    </p>

    <a name="c"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">C: <span class = "familiar pull-right">FAMILIAR</span></h4>
    <p>
        I have been writing less and less C code since I left school, but I really like the power of C.  I use C with the arduino and occasionally write some C to speed up bottle necks in my python code. I would like to write more C.
    </p>

    <a name="haskell"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">haskell: <span class = "learning pull-right">LEARNING</span></h4>
    <p>
        I have been teaching myself haskell when I have time.  I think it is really cool, and I want to explore a strongly typed purely functional programming language.
    </p>

    <a name="objective-c"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">objective c: <span class = "learning pull-right">LEARNING</span></h4>
    <p>
        I have been teaching myself objective c because I want to build native mac, iphone and ipad apps.  So far I think it is really cool and offers a great balance of low level access with effective memory management.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
    <a name="web"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">web development:</h4>
    <p>
        By combining python/ruby, js, html and css, I build some pretty cool stuff online.  Websites are my favorite way to build software, because it is so easy to get it out there while still being able to update it daily.
    </p>

    <a name="appengine"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">google appengine:</h4>
    <p>
        I have a lot of experience building websites on appengine.  It is the quickest way to get a django site up and running.  
    </p>

    <a name="database"></a>
    <h4 class = "skill">databases:</h4>
    <p>
        I mostly work with standard relational databases (oracle, mysql, and postgres) but I am starting to work more with NoSQL solutions.
